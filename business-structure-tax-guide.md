## Business Structure Comparison

### Sole Proprietorship (Default - DO NOT RECOMMEND)

**Structure:**
- You and business are same legal entity
- No formation required
- Report on Schedule C of personal tax return

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple, no paperwork
- ✅ Low cost ($0 to start)
- ✅ Complete control

**Cons:**
- ❌ **NO liability protection** (personal assets at risk)
- ❌ Self-employment tax on ALL income (15.3%)
- ❌ No tax optimization options
- ❌ Hard to sell business
- ❌ Looks unprofessional

**Tax Rate:** 15.3% SE tax + income tax (22-37%) = **37-52% total**

**Verdict:** ❌ **DO NOT USE** for a SaaS business

---

### LLC (Limited Liability Company) - GOOD OPTION

**Structure:**
- Separate legal entity
- "Pass-through" taxation (default)
- Flexible management structure

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Personal liability protection**
- ✅ Simple to form and maintain
- ✅ Flexible taxation (can elect S-Corp)
- ✅ Easy profit distribution
- ✅ Less paperwork than corporation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Self-employment tax on ALL profit (if not S-Corp)
- ❌ State-specific rules vary
- ❌ Annual fees ($50-800/year depending on state)

**Tax Rate (LLC without S-Corp election):** 
- 15.3% SE tax + income tax = **37-52% total**

**Tax Rate (LLC with S-Corp election):**
- Only SE tax on salary portion
- Dividends not subject to SE tax
- Effective rate: **25-35% total** (BIG SAVINGS)

**Verdict:** ✅ **RECOMMENDED** (with S-Corp election when profitable)

---

### S-Corporation - BEST FOR TAX SAVINGS

**Structure:**
- Corporation that elects "S" status
- Pass-through taxation
- Must pay reasonable salary
- Remaining profit = distributions (no SE tax)

**Pros:**
- ✅ **HUGE tax savings** on self-employment tax
- ✅ Liability protection
- ✅ Professional image
- ✅ Easier to sell/transfer
- ✅ More retirement plan options

**Cons:**
- ❌ More paperwork and compliance
- ❌ Must run payroll (costs $50-150/month)
- ❌ Must pay "reasonable salary"
- ❌ Stricter operating requirements
- ❌ Limited to 100 shareholders (not an issue for you)
- ❌ All shareholders must be US citizens/residents

**Tax Rate:**
- Salary: 15.3% SE tax + income tax
- Distributions: Income tax ONLY (no 15.3% SE tax)
- Effective rate: **25-35% total**

**Verdict:** ✅ **BEST FOR TAX SAVINGS** once making $60K+ profit

---

### C-Corporation - NOT RECOMMENDED

**Structure:**
- Traditional corporation
- Double taxation (corporate + personal)
- Complex structure

**Pros:**
- ✅ Unlimited shareholders
- ✅ Can retain earnings
- ✅ Stock options for employees
- ✅ VC-friendly structure

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Double taxation** (21% corporate + income tax on dividends)

## LLC vs S-Corp: Decision Matrix

| Factor | LLC (Default) | LLC + S-Corp | Pure S-Corp |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Formation Cost** | $100-800 | $100-800 + $100 | $100-800 |
| **Annual Cost** | $50-800 | $50-800 + payroll | $50-800 + payroll |

| **Tax Savings** | None | High | High |
| **Flexibility** | High | Medium | Medium |
| **Best For** | <$40K profit | $40K-500K profit | $40K-500K profit |

---

## Recommended Structure

### Phase 1: Starting Out (<$40K profit/year)

**Structure:** LLC (single-member, default taxation)

**Why:**
- Simple and cheap
- Liability protection
- Tax savings not worth complexity yet
- Easy to upgrade later

**Cost:** $100-800 (formation) + $50-800/year (annual fees)

---

### Phase 2: Growing ($40K-$500K profit/year)

**Structure:** LLC with S-Corp election

**Why:**
- Significant tax savings ($6K-$30K/year)
- Still relatively simple
- Payroll costs justified by savings
- Best balance of simplicity and savings

**Cost:** 
- Formation: $100-800 (if not already LLC)
- S-Corp election: $0 (IRS Form 2553)
- Payroll service: $600-1,800/year
- **Tax savings: $6,000-$30,000/year**

**Net Benefit:** $4,200-$28,200/year after costs

---

### Phase 3: Scaling ($500K+ profit/year)

**Structure:** C-Corp (if raising VC) or stay S-Corp

**Why:**
- If bootstrapping: S-Corp still best
- If raising VC: Must convert to C-Corp
- C-Corp needed for stock options, preferred shares

**Cost:** Depends on complexity

---

## Tax Benefits Breakdown

### Self-Employment Tax Savings (BIGGEST BENEFIT)

**How It Works:**

**Sole Prop/LLC (no S-Corp):**
```
Profit: $100,000
Self-Employment Tax (15.3%): $15,300
Income Tax (24%): $24,000
Total Tax: $39,300 (39.3%)
```

**S-Corp:**
```
Profit: $100,000
Salary: $60,000 (reasonable)
Distribution: $40,000

Salary:
- Payroll Tax (15.3%): $9,180
- Income Tax (24%): $14,400
- Subtotal: $23,580

Distribution:
- Payroll Tax: $0 (KEY SAVINGS!)
- Income Tax (24%): $9,600
- Subtotal: $9,600

Total Tax: $33,180 (33.2%)
SAVINGS: $6,120/year (15.6% less)
```

**The Math:**
- You AVOID 15.3% self-employment tax on $40,000
- Savings: $40,000 × 15.3% = **$6,120/year**

---

### What is "Reasonable Salary"?

**IRS Rule:** Must pay yourself fair market wage for your role

**Guidelines:**
- 40-50% of profit is common
- Cannot pay $0 salary
- Cannot pay $10K salary on $200K profit

**Resources:**
- Bureau of Labor Statistics (bls.gov)
- PayScale.com
- Salary.com
- GuideStar for nonprofit comparables

**Job Titles to Research:**
- Software Developer: $70K-150K
- Product Manager: $80K-160K
- CEO/Founder (small tech): $60K-120K

**Safe Harbor (not official IRS rule, but common):**
- Minimum: $40,000-60,000 for tech founder
- Better: 40-50% of net profit
- Conservative: Match industry average for your role

**Red Flags (IRS audit risk):**
- $20K salary on $200K profit (too low)
- $150K salary on $160K profit (defeats purpose)
- $0 salary (illegal)
