## Common Questions

### Q: How do I update the months in Monthly Tracker?
A: The months automatically start from the current month. To change them manually, edit the column headers in row 5 (but keep the format like "Jan 2026").

### Q: What if I get paid biweekly?
A: Multiply your paycheck by 26 (pay periods per year), then divide by 12 to get monthly amount.

### Q: Can I add more expense categories?
A: Yes! Insert rows in the Expenses sheet. Make sure to:
1. Keep it in the right section (e.g., under Housing)
2. Copy the formatting from nearby cells
3. Update the category subtotal formula if needed

### Q: My Dashboard shows red numbers. Is that bad?
A: Red means negative (spending more than you earn). Yes, that's concerning. Review your expenses and look for areas to cut back.

### Q: What's a good savings rate?
A: 
- 20%+ = Excellent
- 15-20% = Very good
- 10-15% = Good
- 5-10% = Acceptable, but could improve
- Below 5% = Needs attention

### Q: Should I include taxes in expenses?
A: No. Enter your after-tax income in the Income sheet, so taxes are already accounted for.

### Q: How often should I update this?
A: 
- Income: When it changes (raise, new job, etc.)
- Budget: Monthly or when life changes
- Monthly Tracker: Weekly or after each purchase
- Goals: Monthly to track progress

### Q: Can I use this for irregular income?
A: Yes! Use your average monthly income from the past 6-12 months. Be conservative.

## Tips for Success

### Getting Started
1. **Be honest**: Accurate data = useful insights
2. **Start simple**: Don't worry about being perfect
3. **Track everything**: Even small purchases add up
4. **Review regularly**: Check weekly, adjust monthly
5. **Set realistic goals**: Aggressive goals often fail

### Monthly Review Process
1. Update Monthly Tracker with actual spending
2. Check Dashboard to see budget vs actual
3. Identify problem areas (red numbers)
4. Adjust next month's budget if needed
5. Update savings goal progress

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Find leaks**: Look for categories consistently over budget
2. **Automate savings**: Set up automatic transfers
3. **Use cash envelopes**: For problem categories
4. **Track daily spending**: Use phone notes or receipt app
5. **Review subscriptions**: Cancel what you don't use
6. **Meal plan**: Reduces food waste and dining out
7. **Wait 24 hours**: For non-essential purchases over $50

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Not tracking cash purchases
- ❌ Forgetting annual expenses (insurance, taxes)
- ❌ Being too restrictive (causes burnout)
- ❌ Not updating when circumstances change
- ❌ Ignoring small daily purchases ($5 coffee = $1,825/year)
- ❌ No emergency fund (leads to debt)
- ❌ Not reviewing and adjusting

## Example Budget (Annual Income: $60,000 / Monthly: $5,000)

### Income
- Salary (after tax): $5,000

### Expenses (Total: $4,000)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Formulas showing errors
**Solution**: Don't delete rows or columns. If you do, formulas break. Instead, set values to 0.

### Problem: Numbers not updating
**Solution**: Make sure you're entering numbers, not text. No dollar signs or commas when typing.

### Problem: Can't edit a cell
**Solution**: You're trying to edit a formula cell (gray background). Only edit blue cells.

### Problem: Savings rate shows 0%
**Solution**: Enter your income in the Income sheet first.

**Solution**: Make sure you're entering expenses in the Monthly Tracker sheet.
